My name is **Jonathan Hui**. I started this blog to share my excitement about Deep Learning. My journey started many years ago when I built a recommendation engine. After the project, I time-boxed myself for 3 months to learn Deep learning. After years, I am still learning and the excitement never dies. The community in Deep learning is sometimes like a secret society. There are secret handshakes and lingos. And the Math is beautify.

$$
E(v, h) = -a^T v - b^T h - v^T W h \\ 
$$

This simple equation represents the core idea of the Boltzmann machine. But for engineers, they get loss easily. 

AI is at a critical stage. To make it succesful, we need influx of engineers understanding both AI and products. I once asked a question to two executives. How do we know this AI approach work? One gives me a mocking challenge on the AI progress but the other describes a risk mitigating product approach. Ideas are great but that is not enough to make great products. We need a wider spectrum of expertises. I wish some of the articles will make the learning process easier.

> In the theoretical Physics, Professor Susskind once said "Fat advanced textbooks are are not suitable to people who have no teacher to ask questions of, and the popular literature does not go deeply enough to satisfy these curious people." 

Many articles here served as my personal and professional footnotes. I re-wrote some of them if people are interested. So if you click on the recommendation button, it helps me to gauge the interests better. For those intersted in connecting with me professionally, you can find me at Linkedin.
