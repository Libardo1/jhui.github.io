I am **Jonathan Hui**, a software architect and a developer in leading and implementing large-scale high-performance application systems. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, large dataset, and cloud computing. I always enjoy explaining software technologies. It gives me deeper insights.  [My previous blog](http://jonathanhui.com) documented major software technologies I used before 2010. However, maintain a Drupal site on a micro AWS instance proves to be challenging. Since then, I switched to a personal confluence on the cloud to document all the latest big data and machine learning technologies. For me, explaining, even to myself is part of an important process to understand technologies. If time allowed, I will like to share more regarding machine learning here.
